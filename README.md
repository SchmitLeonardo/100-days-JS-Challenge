## Day 1: Change Background Color üé®
* **Overview:** This project it's very simple, but i loved doing it. I basically created a button and styled it, I created an array with the colors that should be displayed. In this button I added a click event listener that generates a random number between 0 and 10 that corresponds to the index of the array.
* **What I've learned:** Nothing new, but I could use Math methods that I don't use often.

* **Access:** If you wish you can test it yourself simply by clicking [here](https://codepen.io/schmitleonardo/pen/qBmKVxd) (CodePen) or just view the demo in the video below. ü§ó

## Day 2: HEX Change Background Color üé®
* **Overview:** This project it's very simple, but i loved doing it. I basically created a button and styled it, I created an array with the colors that should be displayed. In this button I added a click event listener that generates a random number between 0 and 10 that corresponds to the index of the array.
* **What I've learned:** I learned a new way to use the Math method, it returns a selection with 6 digits and numbers, a perfect solution for this project.

## Day 3: Random Quote ‚úèÔ∏è
* **Overview:** I really enjoyed doing this project because I could use the gradient background and use a json with a lot of beautiful and motivational quotes. By the way, the json with the quotes I found in this repository [Here](https://gist.github.com/nasrulhazim/54b659e43b1035215cd0ba1d4577ee80).
