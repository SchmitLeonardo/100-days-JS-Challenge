Day 1: Change Background Color ðŸŽ¨
* **Overview:** This project it's very simple, but i loved doing it. I basically created a button and styled it, I created an array with the colors that should be displayed. In this button I added a click event listener that generates a random number between 0 and 10 that corresponds to the index of the array.
* **What I've learned:** Nothing new, but I could use Math methods that I don't use often.
